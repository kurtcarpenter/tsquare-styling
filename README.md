_Well look no further! This repository contains custom CSS you can use to override the default styling! Rejoice, fellow student, for you are free._

##Instructions for Firefox:##
Paste userContent.css into location below (creating chrome directory if it doesn't exist), then re-open Firefox to apply stylesheet: 
* Windows 2000 +: C:\Users\\[user]\AppData\Roaming\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles\[profile-name].default\chrome\
* OS X: ~/Library/Application Support/Firefox/Profiles/[profile-name].default/chrome/
* *nix: ~/.mozilla/firefox/[profile-name].default/chrome/

##Instructions for IE/Edge/Safari/Chrome/Opera:##
* Download Firefox
* Just kidding. Sort of. Support for domain-specific CSS is not yet available in these browsers. I'll have this updated as soon as it is
